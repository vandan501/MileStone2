On the home page, users can see a list of all existing blog posts with their titles and brief summaries.
Users can click on a blog post to view its full content on a separate page.
A "+" icon should be present in the header to add a new blog post, which opens a modal with a form to input the blog title, poster, description, and content.
Upon submitting the form, the new blog post should be added to the list of existing blogs on the home page, and the data should be stored in the LocalStorage.
The application should have a clean and visually appealing design using CSS.
Note: Making the application responsive is optional.

Project 2: Simple Movie Search Web App - Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript Only

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a movie search application that allows users to search for movies using an input box. Upon receiving the user's input, the application fetches movie data from the OMDB API for the specific query and displays the relevant movie details.

Requirements:

The application should have a simple and user-friendly interface built using HTML and CSS.
JavaScript should be used to handle user interactions and fetch data from the OMDB API.
The fetched movie details, such as movie title and poster image, should be displayed on the application interface.
The application should gracefully handle edge cases, such as when a movie is not found or when the user provides invalid input.
Instructions:

Register on the OMDB API website to obtain your API key, which will be required to make requests to the API.
Create an HTML file named "index.html" to set up the basic structure of the web app.
Create a CSS file named "style.css" to style the application.
Implement the functionality in JavaScript file named "script.js" to handle user interactions, fetch data from the OMDB API, and display the fetched movie details on the HTML page.
Project 3: Simple Todo Web App with React
